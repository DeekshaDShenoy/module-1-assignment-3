<h3>Reviews</h3>
<h5>Love this Painting<br>Joe Smith:</h5>
<p>The painting was inspired by the art historical deiction of power;it was a strategy similarly emloyed by Napolean himself,who often used sybolism assiciated with the Roman empires to reinforce his rule.
<hr></hr>
<h5>Its Okay<br>Joe Doe:</h5>
<p>The second painting he sent, in 1840, was The Illness of Antiochus (1840; also known as Aniochus and Stratonice) a history painting on a theme of love and sacrifice, a theme once painted by David in 1800, when Ingres was in his studio. </p>
